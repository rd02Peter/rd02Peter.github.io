Bachelor degree, Physics, 1992 - 1996</p>

<h1 id="autobiography">Autobiography</h1>

<p>I am Peter. I was born in Taipei and I was graduated from the National Chung Hsing University, majoring in physics. I wrote my first computer program when I was 12 years old with Apple2 at home. Since then my interest is studying by myself and coding every day with program languages like basic, c and c++ when I was a kid: Coding is funny and impressive!</p>

<p>I served as unix system administrator in for the computer laboratory around five years in the department of Physics both in NCHU and NTU. My duty was to set up the SUN UNIX and linux workstations with python script code. Meanwhile I needed to maintain daily tasks for the colledge academic network for web mail servers, forums servers, and some electronic bulletin boards. And I have participated in the Microsoft project regards to the development of geographic information system in their new window system called NT.</p>

<p>My first job was served as a seminconductor manufacturing engineer in the discrete component department of the Lite-on semiconductor manufacturing company for three years, I worked as a process for two years and after then I was assigned as a discrete componet device engineer for one year, and I was responsible for technology energy transfer project with the US On-semi semiconductor manufactur company engineers at the time .</p>

<p>I left my first job due to their relocation to China’s new factory. I stayed and worked in the US company Motorola BSC. And I was responsible for the project coordination between the factory production and  the client customer.</p>

<p>In 2006, with the closed of the company’s business in Taiwan, and I found a new job to work to the US company Freescale Semiconductor. And I have participated in freescale starcore DSP chip soc SDK development in flexible programming to achieve communication algorithms, while optimizing the processor and the surrounding performance, to play the base station’s maximum performance. After one year in Freescale, I was assigned and relocated to the Shanghai city , China. And my duty was to set up and managed 100 engineers for the Freescale new soc chip technical support development team.</p>

<p>So far I am aggressive to looking for a job, and please feel free to contact me. Thank you!</p>
